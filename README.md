# python-zero-to-hero

Welcome to my Python Fundamentals repo — where I’m mastering the basics to build toward AI, Machine Learning, and Agentic Systems.

## What’s Inside

-  Variables, Data Types, Operators
-  Control Flow (if/else, loops)
-  Functions
-  Data Structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
-  OOP (Classes & Objects)
-  File Handling & Exceptions
-  Modules & Packages

## Why This Repo Exists

This is the foundation of my AI journey — every LLM, agent, and ML model I build will stand on this.

Let’s build 🧱✨
