## What You’ll Learn

### Core Python Concepts
- Variables, data types, operators, and control flow  
- Functions, arguments, and return types  
- Modules, packages, and imports  
- Error handling and exceptions  
- File handling (CSV, JSON, text files)

### Intermediate Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism  
- Functional Programming: lambda, map, filter, reduce  
- Iterators and Generators  
- Decorators and Context Managers  
- List, dictionary, and set comprehensions  

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to bridge the gap between **Python fundamentals** and **real-world AI applications**.  
It helps you not only learn how to code but how to **think like an engineer** when building data-driven and intelligent systems.

By mastering these foundations, you’ll be prepared to explore:
- Advanced AI and LLM frameworks  
- Cloud-based data engineering workflows  
- Scalable ML pipelines and production-ready AI tools
